### Smart Barrier-Free Access (SmartBFA)
[Project website](https://smartbfa.com/)  
[Tech poster](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFBk8BAoD4/dBsr2iFutYPfMJhXMWTvAQ/view?utm_content=DAFBk8BAoD4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)

- Participated in developing a navigation tool to help wheelchair users find barrier-free accessible paths in Singapore
- Modified GraphHopper API by using JavaScipt to conduct map matching on GPS trajectories of accessible paths collected by the wheelchair volunteers
- Developed machine learning algorithms to detect the transition points between paths and open spaces for further routing generation by applying hidden Markov model and logistic regression

### Improving Quantal Cognitive Hierarchy Model Through Iterative Population Learning (QCHIPL)
[Publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06033)

- Perform cross-validation on the developed Quantal Cognitive Hierarchy - Iterative Population Learning (QCH-IPL) model and compare the prediction results with baseline models
- Developed codes in Python to organize the entire workflow and conducted implementations of data preparation, model training, results comparison, and visualizations

### Mining real estate ads and property transactions for building and amenity data acquisition
[Publication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44212-022-00012-2)

- Developed an entirely new mechanism to maintain spatial databases by detecting unmapped buildings and amenities and adding unfilled building attributes detected from real estate data
- Extracted locations and attributes of buildings and amenities from 295,880 real estate listings and 954,510 transaction records by using Python and R 
- The mechanism can achieve accuracy rates of over 90% in identifying locations of unmapped amenities and adding unfilled building attributes
